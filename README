Simulation and Graph-generation utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository contains Perl modules and scripts developed as core or
protocol-independent components of network protocol simulation and
visualization tools, during 2006-2007.

These files are not useful by themselves - actual simulation and
visualization logic have to be built on top of features provided by
these Perl codes, e.g. job scheduling, input parameter handling, and
drawing abstract interfaces.
